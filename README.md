Assorted command line scripts for common tasks.

aggerate
--------

Assumes that each line in the input is a `key value` pair, and aggregates
together all the values of each key. The default options assume that each
`value` is a number, and adds them all together.

coinflip
--------

Generates a random sequence of values drawn, following some probability
distribution, from a given set of elements. The default options produce
a random coin flip from a fair coin.
